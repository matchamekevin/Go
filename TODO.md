# Refactoring Plan for Admin and Back Codebases - COMPLETED ✅

## Admin Refactoring ✅
- [x] Break down SotralManagementPage.tsx into smaller components (LineTable, LineModal, StatsCards, ErrorDisplay)
- [x] Extract API calls into custom hooks (useSotralLines, useSotralStops, useSotralStats)
- [x] Fix component props issues and remove complex modal code
- [x] Simplify edit modal to use text inputs instead of dropdowns
- [x] Clean up TypeScript errors (unused imports, variables, interfaces)
- [x] Improve error handling with a centralized error context or hook
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- [x] Implement loading states and optimistic updates

## Back Refactoring ✅
- [x] Add middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling
- [x] Organize routes into logical groups (e.g., auth, admin, public)
- [x] Add logging and monitoring for API endpoints
- [x] Optimize database queries with indexes and pagination
- [x] Ensure consistent response formats across endpoints

## General Improvements ✅
- [x] Add unit tests for key components and API endpoints
- [x] Improve documentation for APIs and components
- [x] Ensure consistency between admin and back APIs

## Followup Steps ✅
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- [x] Deploy and test in development environment
- [x] Gather feedback for further iterations
